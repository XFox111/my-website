# Security Policy

This is a personal website project, so it doesn't really require policies on reporting vulnerabilities.
But in case you have found one, I will be glad if you report it :)

## Reporting vulnerabilities

Here's a basic guideline on how to do this:

1. Send an email to opensource@xfox111.net
1. Give a clear description of the issue, including how to reproduce it and what impact it might have.
1. If you can, include a proof-of-concept or screenshot showing the problem.

I'll do my best to address any issues and give you an update.

Thank you <3
