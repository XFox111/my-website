# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to the project! We welcome your help and appreciate your support.

## General guidelines

- **Follow templates:** Use the provided issue and pull request templates to ensure consistency and completeness. Be concise.
- **Follow Single responisibility principle:** Each contribution must correspond to a single area of work. Don't mix them up (e.g. fixing a bug and adding a new feature in the same PR).
- **Code of Conduct:** Be sure to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing Process

1. **Create an Issue:** Before starting work, check the issue tracker to see if a relevant issue already exists. If not, create a new issue to describe the bug or feature.

2. **Get Assigned:** Make sure you are assigned to an issue before beginning any work. This helps prevent duplicate efforts.

3. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

4. **Work on Your Changes:** Create a new branch for your work and make your changes.

5. **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear, concise commit messages.

6. **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Once your changes are ready, open a PR. Ensure you link the PR to the corresponding issue.

7. **Review Process:** Be responsive to feedback and make any requested changes.
