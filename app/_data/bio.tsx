export const Bio: React.FC = () => <>
	<p>I am a software engineer who loves desiging and building complex services, creating nice intuitive applications, and solving engineering challenges.</p>
	<p>I started programming in 2018 because I am not a good artist, and programming allows to bring my visions and ideas to life. My specialty is React and .NET in web development, but I always look out for other fields and tools as well.</p>
	<p>Thanks to my quick adaptation and communication skills, I can either be a good team player, or handle tasks independently.</p>
	<p>Graduated from <a href="https://sut.ru/eng" target="_blank">Bonch-Bruevich University of Telecommunications</a>. In 2023 received Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer science, then in 2025 – Master&apos;s in Radiotechnology. Despite that, I began my career path much earlier and consider myself a self-taught developer.</p>
	<p>In my free time I like to play some instruments, pilot a 737 in a flightsim, or just keep working, but on my own pet projects.</p>
