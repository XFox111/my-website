		<p>My journey as a programmer started in 2018 from a silly free-time hobby. Since then, I have released a couple of personal projects, some of which have become quite popular.</p>
		<p>Graduated from <a href="https://sut.ru/eng" target="_blank">Bonch-Bruevich University of Telecommunications</a> in 2023 where I got my Bachelor&apos;s degree in computer science. It was fun. Took part in a number of hackathons (usually first place for us) as well as science conferences (including those hosted by IEEE). In 2025 got Master&apos;s in Radiotechnology.</p>
		<p>Also, before graduation I managed to work in several different companies in different IT fields (mostly software development, of course).</p>
		<p>Out-of-box thinking, and constant self-improvement is my life strategy. New tool released? - Yes, please! GitHub is hosting another conference? - Sign me up! There is a new challenging task to complete? - Oh, boy, here we go again! So many things to learn, so little time to spare...</p>
		<p>Overall, enthusiastic, fast learning and energetic person. Love coding and creating something new. Like to draw and compose music. Aviasim enthusiast. Proud member of the furry community.</p>
