		"My name is Eugene Fox. I am a professional software developer primarily focused on .NET and React projects.",

		"My journey as a programmer started in 2018 from a silly free-time hobby. Since then, I have released a couple of personal projects, some of which have become quite popular.",

		"Graduated from Bonch-Bruevich University of Telecommunications in 2023 where I got my bachelor's degree in computer science. It was fun. Took part in a number of hackathons (usually first place for us) as well as science conferences (including those hosted by IEEE).",

		"Also, before graduation I managed to work in several different companies in different IT fields (mostly software development, of course).",

		"Out-of-box thinking, and constant self-improvement is my life strategy. New tool released? - Yes, please! GitHub is hosting another conference? - Sign me up! There is a new challenging task to complete? - Oh, boy, here we go again! So many things to learn, so little time to spare...",

		"Overall, enthusiastic, fast learning and energetic person. Love coding and creating something new. Like to draw and compose music. Proud member of the furry community."
